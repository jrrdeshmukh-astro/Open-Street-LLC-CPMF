# Codified Program Management Framework - Workflow Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Codified Program Management Framework workflow from [openstreet.info](https://openstreet.info/).

## Overview

The Codified Program Management Framework is a structured, repeatable approach to designing, governing, and facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement between government, industry, and academia. The framework focuses on **process and governance**, not outcomes or decision-making.

## Framework Lifecycle

The framework follows a structured lifecycle with four main stages:

1. **Initiation** - Program setup and planning
2. **Engagement** - Active stakeholder interaction
3. **Synthesis** - Insight capture and analysis
4. **Continuation** - Follow-on activities and program evolution

## Implementation Steps
