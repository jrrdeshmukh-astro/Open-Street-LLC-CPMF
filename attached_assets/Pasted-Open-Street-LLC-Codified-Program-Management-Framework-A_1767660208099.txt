Open Street LLC
Codified Program Management Framework
A Structured, Compliant Approach to Multi-Stakeholder Engagement

Overview
Open Street LLC offers a Codified Program Management Framework — a documented, repeatable approach to designing, governing, and facilitating structured engagement between government, industry, and academia.
This framework formalizes how engagement is planned, conducted, and sustained, ensuring consistency, transparency, and compliance across programs. It focuses on process and governance, not outcomes, access, or decision-making.

What “Codified” Means
Codified program management means that engagement is:
Documented – roles, rules, and workflows are written and explicit
Repeatable – programs follow a consistent lifecycle and structure
Governed – engagement operates within defined compliance guardrails
Auditable – artifacts and decisions are traceable to documented process
The framework reduces reliance on ad hoc practices or individual discretion.

What the Framework Is Not
The Codified Program Management Framework does not:
Influence decisions or outcomes
Provide access to government officials
Support procurement or contracting activities
Endorse participants or solutions
The framework governs how engagement occurs, not what decisions are made.

How Organizations Use the Framework
Organizations may use the framework to:
Participate in Open Street–managed engagement programs
Adopt structured engagement practices internally
Ensure compliant interaction across diverse stakeholders
Engagement scope and commercial terms are defined separately.

Compliance Statement
Open Street LLC operates as a neutral program manager. All engagement under this framework is informational and non-solicitation in nature. Participation does not imply endorsement, obligation, or contractual commitment.

Open Street codifies engagement so collaboration is structured, governed, and sustainable.
